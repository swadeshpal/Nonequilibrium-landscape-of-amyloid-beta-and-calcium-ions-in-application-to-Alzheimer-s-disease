# For Fig.1, run Fig_1.m (SSA.mw is used to find the confidential ellipses) 

# In our simulation, we have used the data Data_83.gml, which is available at www.braingraph.org

# First, we find the Laplacian for the brain connectome data Data_83.gml by Laplacian.m

# For Fig.2, run Fig_2.m

# For Fig.3, run Fig_3.m

# For Fig.4, run Fig_4.m
